# aws-deeplearning-cloudwatch

This repository is inspired by the blog post titled "Monitoring GPU Utilization with Amazon CloudWatch"
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/monitoring-gpu-utilization-with-amazon-cloudwatch/

These scripts improve upon the example provided in the blog and allow Deep Learning EC2 instances to post GPU performance metrics in their own namespaces based on the EC2 tag name.
